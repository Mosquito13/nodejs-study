## NoSQL & Using MongoDB

### NoSQL/MongoDB

* Alternative to SQL databases
* No strict schemas, fewer relations
* You can of course use schemas and reference-based relations but you got more flexibility
* Often, relations are also created by embedding other documents/data

### Working with MongoDB

* Use the official MongoDB Driver
* Commands like `insertOne()`, `find()`, `updateOne()`, and `deleteOne()` make CRUD-operations very simple
* Check the official docs to learn about all available operations + configurations/operators
* All operations are promise-based, hence you can easily chain them for more complex flows
